# January 2020 Road Trip

Cait and I recently took a two week road trip across the mountain west. We spent a lot of time resort riding, splitboarding, hanging with good friends, and eating great food. It was great to get back into the mountains and get the riding legs back under me after a solid fall of primarily paddling around the ocean. Interspersed throughout the trip Cait interviewed at various places including Santa Cruz, Denver, Silverthorne, and Durango. Full spectrum family physicians in rural locations are in high demand!

Below are a few stats and photos from our trip.
