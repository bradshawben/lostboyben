# Pennsylvania Creek - Red Mountain Tour

A few of our good friends from Cait's medical school years were in Breckenridge for the holiday weekend, so we decided to head to Breck to spend some time with them. The previous week has finally brought some decent snow, and along with it, a considerably sketchy avalanche forecast. Considerable avalanche danger doesn't usually scream "ski a 13er!", but that's where you'd be wrong! Red Mountain out of Pennsylvania Creek offers an abundance of gorgeous powder glades and even some alpine exposure, all at a low angle that's approachable in the winter. The views on the ascent were fantastic (see below) and the descent is always a killer rollercoaster ride with logs covered in trap door powder and a even few tree barrels down lower. There wasn't a stitch of wind, and the sun even came out exposing some impressive views of the Ten Mile range down valley.

On a side note, the temperature inversion this weekend was unbelievable. Denver was single digits or below while Summit County was in the 20s. As we drove back down I70 we watched the temperature plunge from 25 at near 13,000 feet to below zero in Evergreen at 7000 feet. Definitely missing February in Ventura right about now!



Top notch views of the Ten Mile Range.
