# Pennsylvania Creek - Red Mountain Tour

A few of our good friends from Cait's years in medical school were in Breckenridge for the holiday weekend, so we decided to head to Breck to spend some time with them. The previous week has finally brought some decent snow, and along with it some considerable sketchy snow. At times like these meadow skipping up Red Mountain out of Pennsylvania Creek is the call-- beautiful, low angle glades that still allow you to get up high without having to think too hard about the snowpack. The views on the ascent were fantastic (see below) and the descent is always a killer rollercoaster ride with logs covered in trap door powder and a few tree barrels down lower. Overall, a great Valentine's day out with my lady.

On a side note, the temperature inversion this weekend was unbelievable. Denver was single digits or below while Summit County was in the 20's. As we drove back down 70 we watching the temperature plunge from close to 30 to below zero in Evergreen was hard to believe as a native Californian.



Top notch views of the Ten Mile Range.
