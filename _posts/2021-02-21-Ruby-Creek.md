# Pennsylvania Creek - Red Mountain Tour

The weeks have been absolutely flying by. Yesterday we took a few friends up to Red Mountain to try to capitalize on the goods we found up there last weekend. We had a great time, but the top section had been entirely stripped by the wind and the snow has taken on an interesting dense marshmallow consistency which made for a fun surf like ride through the trees. The trailhead parking lot was entirely full, so we ended up having to park at the bottom of the neighborhoods. Skiing down was. . .interesting. I've never actively snowboarded down a road that had auto traffic on it-- chalk it up to new life experiences.

Today we decided to head to an oldie but a goodie, Ruby Creek by Henderson Mine. It's a beautiful skin up into a crowned valley surrounded by [Bard Peak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bard_Peak) and [Mount Parnassas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Parnassus_(Colorado)). The skin up was great, we only saw one other group the whole day out. Unfortunately we learned too late that our wax situation was a bit dire, and given that we were sticking to low angle terrain this made skiing out the creek bed slow going. We decided to cut across to the skin track which was pretty comical-- us trying to swim across the short 20 meters from the creekbed to the fireroad. On the way down the fireroad I ducked a tree, but didn't quite make it all the way under. The branch puntured my helmet, and took a swat at my face. Luckily the helmet took the brunt of the impact, but I do have a pretty sweet (superficial) Heath Ledger Joker cut next to my lip. Why so serious?



Eyeing the spring objective.
