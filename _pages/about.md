My name is Ben Bradshaw. I am a researcher, developer, writer, and adventurer, but not necessarily in that order. I enjoy applying technology (particularly in the form of software) in order to make the world a better place. Over the course of my career I have worked as a microeconomics research associate at the [San Francisco Federal Reserve](https://www.frbsf.org/), a high school math teacher with [Teach for America](https://www.teachforamerica.org/), and a data scientist at [Guild Education](https://www.guildeducation.com/). Currently, I am a lead data scientist at [Evidation Health](https://evidation.com/) where I lead a team of data scientists and engineers to support analytics infrastructure and R&D supporting core business functions. In a previous life, I also was a member of the [US National Cycling Team](https://www.usacycling.org/team-usa).

I value balance and breadth of experience in my life. My passion for cycling, surfing, climbing, snowboarding, and guitar are important channels that provide these experiences. I'm married to an incredible woman named Caitlin, who is a family medicine doctor. We currently live in Denver, Colorado.
